A blessing in disguise
A sandwich short of a picnic
A stone's throw
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
Add insult to injury
I'm all ears
At a crossroads
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat about the bush
Better late than never
Between a rock and a hard place
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite the bullet
Blow off steam
Bob's your uncle
Bog-standard
Botch job
Budge up
Builder's tea
Bury your head in the sand
Bust your chops
By the skin of your teeth
Call a spade a spade
Call it a day
Cheap as chips
Chinese whispers
Chip on your shoulder
Clam up
Cold feet
Cold shoulder
Cost a bomb
Cost an arm and a leg
Couch potato
Couldn't care less
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut a long story short
Cut corners
Cut someone some slack
Cut to the chase
Dig your heels in
Dog eat dog
Don't give up the day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't run before you can walk
Desperate times call for desperate measures
Easy does it
Eat a horse
The elephant in the room
Every cloud has a silver lining
Face the music
Find your feet
Finger in every pie
A fish out of water
Fit as a fiddle
Follow in someone's footsteps
Freak out
Full of beans
Get off your back
Get out of hand
Get over something
Get something out of your system
Get up/out on the wrong side of bed
Get your act/sht together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Glad to see the back of
Go back to the drawing board
Go cold turkey
Go down that road
Go the extra mile
The grass is always greener on the other side
Green fingers
Hang in there
Have eyes in the back of your head
Head over heels
Heard it on the grapevine
Hit the books
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the road
Hit the sack
Hold your horses
Ignorance is bliss
It's not rocket science
Jump on the bandwagon
Jump ship
Keep your chin up
Kill two birds with one stone
Leave no stone unturned
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let someone off the hook
Let the cat out of the bag
Look like a million dollars
Lose your touch
Miss the boat
Nip it in the bud
No pain, no gain
No-brainer
Not your cup of tea
Off your trolley/rocker/nut/head
Off the top of your head
On the ball
On the pull
On the straight and narrow
Once in a blue moon
Piece of cake
And pigs might fly
Pitch in
Play it by ear
Pull someone's leg
Pull yourself together
Raise your game
Ring a bell
Rock the boat
Rule of thumb
Scratch someone's back
See eye to eye
Shed light on something
Shoot from the hip
Sit tight
Sleep on it
Smell a rat
So far, so good
A spanner in the works
Speak of the devil
Spill the beans
Splash out
Stab someone in the back
Steal someone's thunder
Stick to your guns
Straight from the horse's mouth
Take the piss
Take it with a pinch of salt
A taste of your own medicine
The ball is in your court
The best of both worlds
The last/final straw
Through thick and thin
Time flies when you're having fun
Twist someone's arm
Under the weather
Up in the air
Waste not, want not
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wild goose chase
Wouldn't be caught dead
Wrap your head around something
You can say that again
You can't judge a book by its cover
Your guess is as good as mine
When hell freezes over
